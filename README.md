<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Mohammad ðŸ‘‹</h1>

ðŸ”­ Hi! Iâ€™m a passionate Junior Web Developer with strong skills in both Frontend and Backend development. I enjoy creating complete, functional, and user-friendly web applications.

On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and engaging interfaces. On the backend, I use Python and Django to develop secure, efficient, and scalable systems.

While Iâ€™m capable of delivering full-stack projects, my goal is to join a company in one primary roleâ€”either frontend or backendâ€”bringing my expertise in the other as an additional advantage to the team.

Iâ€™m also expanding my skills to include React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with the goal of building a full project using a Django-powered API.

My core skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Django REST Framework, and Git.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
* Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(ES6), Bootstrap
* Back-End: Python, Django
* Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL
* Tools: Git, Linux
