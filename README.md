<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Mohammad ðŸ‘‹</h1>

ðŸ”­ Hi! Iâ€™m a Junior Frontend Developer passionate about building responsive, user-friendly, and modern web interfaces.

I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Iâ€™m expanding my expertise with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to create clean, scalable, and interactive applications.

Alongside my frontend focus, I also have hands-on experience with Python, Django, and REST APIs, which allows me to understand the bigger picture of web applications and collaborate effectively with backend teams.

I have built full-stack projects, such as a feature-rich blog platform with authentication, role-based access, premium content, and search functionality â€” showcasing both my frontend creativity and backend problem-solving.

## Core Skills:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Responsive Design, React (in progress), TypeScript (in progress), Tailwind CSS (in progress)

Backend: Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL

Tools: Git, GitHub, Version Control

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m eager to grow as a frontend developer while bringing my backend knowledge as an additional advantage to the team. Letâ€™s connect!
